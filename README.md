## About
The goal is to provide an exhaustive analysis of a malware called <strong>Wirenet</strong>, reverse engineer it and provide a signature.  
On top of the decompiled source code, there is a ~ 30 page report (italian only) that goes in depth into its inner workings and an article (english) that focuses on the implementation of the keylogger.
